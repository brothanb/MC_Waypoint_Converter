# MC_Waypoint_Converter
Scripts for converting waypoints for various Minecraft Mods.

VoxelMap waypoint files can typically be found in the voxelmap folder in your .minecraft folder.  There is a single file for each server, named something.points.

Likewise, the Xareos Waypoints can be found in the XaeroWaypoints folder in your .minecraft folder.  There will be another folder for each server along with additional folders and files.

The scripts will do their best to convert the waypoints.
